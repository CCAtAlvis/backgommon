# TimeseriesTable: Possible Improvements & Optimizations

This document outlines potential improvements and optimizations for the `TimeseriesTable` implementation in `backgommon/pkg/types/timeseries_table.go`.

---

## 1. Redundant Data Structures
- **timestampMap** and **timestampArr** are both maintained for fast lookup and ordered iteration.
- **Improvement:** Encapsulate all timestamp insertions/removals in helper methods to ensure they are always kept in sync and to avoid bugs.

## 2. isDirty and Sorting
- `isDirty` is used to defer sorting of `timestampArr` until iteration.
- **Improvement:**
  - If iteration is frequent, consider using a sorted data structure (e.g., skip list, sorted slice with binary search for insertions).
  - If keeping this pattern, ensure all public methods that rely on order always check and sort if dirty.

## 3. Type Assertions and Generics
- Many places use `any(candleValue).(core.Candle)` and `any(candleValue).(*core.Candle)`.
- **Improvement:**
  - If possible, restrict `T` with a type constraint to avoid repeated type assertions.
  - If not, document the expectation that `T` should be `core.Candle` or `*core.Candle`.

## 4. GetRow, GetValue, SetValue
- These methods do type assertions and ignore errors.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider logging or handling type assertion failures, as they may indicate a bug or data corruption.
  - If only one type is expected, consider panicking or returning an error on failure.

## 5. Iterator and Rows
- Both methods sort if dirty, then iterate over `timestampArr`.
- **Improvement:**
  - If both the row and timestamp are often needed, consider returning a struct or tuple with both.

## 6. ApplyIndicatorToColumn
- Now optimized to only process valid candles, with no redundant checks in the update loop.
- **Improvement:**
  - None needed at this time, but keep an eye on performance for very large tables.

## 7. ApplyIndicator, ApplyIndicators, ApplyIndicatorsToColumn
- These methods apply indicators to all columns or a specific column.
- **Improvement:**
  - Pre-filter columns to avoid unnecessary work if only a few have candle data.
  - Consider parallelizing indicator application if performance is a concern and indicators are independent.

## 8. Error Handling
- Some methods return errors, others return zero values on failure.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider a consistent error handling strategy: always return an error, always return a boolean, or document the behavior.

## 9. Table Abstraction
- The underlying `Table` type is used for storage.
- **Improvement:**
  - If `Table` is not optimized for sparse data, consider a sparse matrix or map-of-maps for very large, sparse timeseries.

## 10. Go Idioms
- Use of `any` is necessary for generics, but can be avoided if you restrict `T`.
- Use of `map[string]interface{}` is flexible but not type-safe.
- **Improvement:**
  - Prefer type safety where possible, or document the schema expectations.

## 11. Documentation and Comments
- Some methods have comments, but not all.
- **Improvement:**
  - Add comments to all exported methods and types for clarity and maintainability.

## 12. Testing
- Not visible in the file, but essential.
- **Improvement:**
  - Ensure tests cover: sparse data, type assertion failures, indicator application with missing data.

## 13. Concurrency
- No explicit concurrency support.
- **Improvement:**
  - If concurrent reads/writes are expected, add locks or use sync.Map.

## 14. Memory Usage
- Large numbers of timestamps or columns can lead to high memory usage.
- **Improvement:**
  - Consider lazy loading, chunking, or using a database for very large datasets.
